## 1. Definition
**Remediation** is the process of **resolving incidents** or **automatically handling** issues that arise in the system to ensure stable service operation, minimize downtime, and reduce operational risks.

## 2. Objectives
- **Automate** error handling to minimize manual intervention.
- **Reduce response time** when incidents occur.
- **Maintain high availability** for the system.
- **Ensure compliance** with operational standards.

## 3. Benefits
- **Quickly resolve issues** as soon as they are detected.
- **Reduce workload** for the operations team (Ops team).
- **Prevent incidents from spreading** and causing greater impact.
- **Increase infrastructure reliability**.

## 4. Key Components
1. **Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - Use tools like AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, etc., to detect incidents.
2. **Trigger Remediation Process**  
   - Through **AWS Lambda**, **Automation Script**, or **Runbook**.
3. **Execute Remediation Actions**  
   - Example: Reboot DB, scale resources, restart services.
4. **Logging & Reporting**  
   - Store logs, send notifications, analyze root causes (Root Cause Analysis).

## 5. Examples in AWS
- When a **CloudWatch Alarm** detects RDS CPU usage exceeding the threshold, a **Lambda function** automatically reboots the database.
- When an **EC2 instance** loses connection, a script automatically creates a replacement instance.

## 6. Basic Workflow
1. **Incident Detection** (Alarm triggered).
2. **Identify Root Cause** (CloudWatch logs, metrics).
3. **Trigger Remediation** (Lambda, Automation).
4. **Perform Remediation Action**.
5. **Verify & Record Results**.

## 7. Conclusion
Remediation plays a crucial role in **protecting the system** and **maintaining continuous operations**.  
When combined with **automation**, the system can respond quickly and minimize operational risks.
